<h4> Andorra Recipe: Trinxat </h4>
<img src="b.jpg" height= 300px width= 400px>
  <p> Ingredients </p>
  <li>Salt </li>
  <li>1 2-lb. savoy cabbage, tough outer leaves discarded </li>
  <li>2 lbs. russet potatoes, peeled </li>
<li>  12 thick slices of meaty salt pork or bacon </li>
<li>  3 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil </li>
<li>  1 clove garlic, peeled and minced </li>
  <li>2 1/2 oz. fatback, rind removed, thinly sliced </li>
<li>  freshly ground black pepper </li>
</ul>
 <p> Recipe </p>
<ol>
  <li>Bring two pots of generously salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Place the cabbage in one and potatoes in the other.
  <li>Lower the heat in the cabbage pot and simmer until very tender, usually 45-50 minutes: boil the potatoes until they are tender, usually about 25 minutes if you've left the potatoes whole, 15-20 minutes if they've been quartered.
  <li>Drain the potatoes, allow them to dry off briefly over low heat, and then transfer to a large bowl. Drain the cabbage in a colander, and allow to cool slightly; then pull out and discard the core, and drain again, pressing the cabbage to release water. Add the cabbage to potatoes, and mash together with a potato masher. Season to taste with salt, and set aside.</li>
  <li>Working in batches, lightly brown the salt pork on both sides in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat; then drain on paper towels, and set aside. Pour off the fat and wipe skillet clean with paper towels. Heat oil in the same skillet over medium heat.</li>
  <li>Add the garlic and cook until soft, 2-3 minutes; then add oil and garlic to the cabbage mixture, stirring in well. In the same skillet, heat half the fatback until fat is rendered. Add half the cabbage mixture, and flatten into a 1/2"-thick pancake. Cook over high heat until a bottom crust has formed and the trinxat slides easily in the skillet, 5-10 minutes. </li>
  <li>Invert a large plate over skillet, and carefully flip trinxat over; then slide it back into skillet, browned side up. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and cook until bottom is browned, 5-10 minutes. transfer to a platter. </li>
  <li>Repeat the process with remaining cabbage mixture to make a second trinxat. To serve, cut each trinxat into thirds and garnish each with 2 strips salt pork. </li>

<h4> Armenia Recipe: Ghapama </h4>
<img src="c.jpg" height= 300px width= 400px>
<p> Ingredients </p>
<ul>
<li>1 whole 5kg Jacko pumpkin (basketball-sized) </li>
<li>1.5 kg half-boiled long-grain white rice (jasmine rice works nicely) </li>
<li>250 g (2 cups) sultanas </li>
<li>360 g (2 cups) dried apricots, chopped </li>

<li>Carefully slice the pumpkin in a circle close to the top (retaining the lid) and spoon out the seeds and fibrous material inside. </li>
<li>In a big bowl, mix the half-boiled rice with the dried fruit. </li>
<li>Spoon the rice and dried fruit mixture into the pumpkin. When the pumpki  is about half full, pour in 175 g (6 oz/ ½ cup) of honey and 125 g (4½ oz) of melted butter so that it’s evenly distributed over the rice mixture. </li>
<li>Continue to fill the pumpkin with the rice and dried fruit mixture. Once the mixture is almost full to the top, pour in the remaining honey and melted butter – again, so it’s evenly distributed over the mixture. </li>

<h4>  Austria Recipe: Tirolean Dumplings</h4>
<img src="d.jpg" height= 300px width= 400px>
<p> Ingredients </p>
<ul>
  <li>200g bread for dumplings (small cubes of dried white bread or crumbled white rolls) </li>
  <li>Approx. 200ml milk </li>
  <li>100g smoked ham and/or spicy sausage (cured sausage etc.)</li>
<li>  3 eggs</li>
  <li>2 shallots or 1 small onion</li>
  <li>Butter or clarified butter for sweating the onions</li>
  <li>2 tbsp freshly chopped parsley </li>
  <li>2 tbsp flour</li>
  <li>Salt, pepper, a pinch of nutmeg</li>
  <li>Melted butter</li>
  <li>Chopped parsley</li>

</ul>

<p> Recipe </p>

<ol>

  <li>Finely chop the shallots, and dice the smoked ham or sausage into small cubes. Heat some butter or clarified butter in a pan and sweat the onions in it until translucent. Add the meat and the parsley and fry together briefly, before removing from the heat. </li>
  <li>Place the bread in a bowl. Beat the milk with the eggs and season well with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Pour over the bread. Stir in the sausage and onion paste and mix in the flour. Mix together to form a relatively firm paste (adding more bread or flour if necessary) and season again according to taste. Smooth the surface of the dough out and leave to stand for approx. 30 minutes. </li>
  <li>Heat up a good quantity of salted water in a large pan. Use the paste to form smaller dumplings (for use as a garnish in soups) or medium-sized dumplings, as required. Moisten the hands regularly with cold water during this stage, so that the dumplings take on smooth forms. </li>
  <li>Place into the boiling water, bring back to the boil and then turn down the heat and allow to simmer gently for around 8-20 minutes, depending on the size. </li>
  <li>Remove from the water, dry off well serve up, garnished with chopped parsley and melted butter (which has been taken on a nut-brown colour). </li>

  <li>  Work the dough with a wooden spoon or with your hands until the dough is smooth and no longer sticks to the bowl. Leave the dough in the bowl, cover with a clean cloth and let it rise for 35 minutes or until it has doubled in size. </li>
<li>  Once it is rested, carefully tip out the dough onto a floured surface, stretch it out into a square and cut out about 10 cm (3,93 inch) round shapes with a big glass (a big cookie cutter also works). Stretch out each piece with your fingers into a round shape with the centre being thinner than the edges. Let the pieces rest for another 30 minutes on the floured surface. </li>
<li>  In a saucepan, heat sunflower oil. Place the langos into the hot oil, fry it on one side until golden brown then turn. Repeat with the remaining langos dough. </li>

  <h4> Italy Recipe: Gnocchi with parsley, butter & samphire</h4>
<img src="it.jpg" height= 300px width= 400px>
  <p> Ingredients </p>
  <ul>
<li>900g floury potatoes, roughly the same size or halved if large, unpeeled</li>
<li>50g salted butter</li>
<li>1 medium egg, beaten</li>
<li>280g plain white flour</li>

<li>200g samphire</li>
<li>2 small packs parsley, chopped</li>
  </ul>

  <p> Recipe </p>
  <ol>
    <li>To make the gnocchi, cook the potatoes in boiling water for 40-50 mins until very tender, then drain well. Peel away the skin and press through a sieve or a potato ricer into a bowl. </li>
    <li>While the potatoes are still warm, add 1 tsp salt, the butter, egg and half the flour. Lightly mix together and turn out onto a floured board. Gradually knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a smooth, soft but slightly sticky dough. </li>

	  <ul>
	    <li>400g waxy potatoes </li>
	    <li>1 large egg, beaten </li>
	  <li>1 shallot, finely diced </li>
	  <li> 250g pork mince</li>
	    <li>Half a tsp ground caraway seeds</li>
	  <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
	  <li>  1 tbsp plain flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
	<li>  2 tbsp dried porcini mushrooms</li>
	    <li>1 tsp butter</li>
	      <li>  2 shallots, finely diced</li>
	    <li>200g chestnut mushrooms, sliced</li>
	  <li>  200g crème fraiche</li>
	  <li>  2 rashers smoked streaky bacon</li>
	  <li>  1 tbsp chopped dill</li>
	  <li>  green vegetables</li>
	  <li>  crusty bread</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p> Recipe </p>

	  <ol>
	  <li>  Divide the potatoes into 2 batches. Chop one batch into large chunks and boil for 15-20 mins until tender, then drain and mash. Finely grate the remaining potatoes using the smallest blade on a grater and tip into a large bowl lined with a clean tea towel. Bring the edges of the tea towel together and squeeze tightly to expel any liquid; keep 2 tbsp of this juice and discard the rest. In another large mixing bowl, add the reserved potato juice, the grated potato, mashed potato and half of the beaten egg. Beat everything together well, season, set aside to cool, then chill while you prepare the filling.</li>
	    <li>Mix together the shallot, pork mince, caraway seeds, garlic, remaining egg and some seasoning.</li>
	    <li>Mix 1 tbsp of flour into your potato mixture and divide into 8. Dust the work surface with flour and make sure there is flour on your hands too, as the mixture can be quite sticky. Lightly shape the potato dough into flat round patties, approximately 1cm thick. Put 1 heaped tsp of the pork filling in the middle of each patty, then gently pull the dough up and around to encase the pork and form a dumpling. Roll them in your hands to achieve the signature zeppelin shape. Repeat with the rest of the patties and filling.</li>
	    <li>Bring a large saucepan of water to a rolling boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Carefully lower in the dumplings, cover and simmer gently for 30 mins. Keep an eye on this - the water must not boil or the dumplings won't hold their shape.</li>
	    <li>Meanwhile, grill the bacon until crisp, then chop into very small pieces and set aside. To make the sauce, pour 100ml of boiling water over the dried porcini and leave to stand for 5 mins. In a saucepan, heat the butter and add the shallots, frying gently until they are soft and translucent. Add the chestnut mushrooms and cook for 5 mins more. When they are cooked, pour in 1 tbsp of the liquor from the porcini and discard the rest. Chop the porcini and add them to the pan. Fold in the crème fraîche, bring to a simmer, then season.</li>
	    <li>Put 2 dumplings on each plate and pour over the mushroom sauce. Sprinkle the dill and bacon pieces over just before serving with green veg and crusty bread to mop up the sauce. </li>

	<ol>



	<li>Grate the potatoes and place in a bowl. Mix flour and salt with potatoes until you get a thick, sticky dough. </li>

	<li>Chop bacon into small cubes and fry in 1/2 Tablespoon oil on low heat until crisp and brown. Meanwhile bring a large pot of water to a boil and add some salt to it. </li>

	<li>Test a small spoonful of the halusky mix in the boiling water. It should cook into a soft dumpling in 3-4 minutes. If the mix seem like it's not holding together, add more flour to thicken. </li>

	<li>The traditional way to make the halusky is to put the batter on a cutting board and cut small dumplings (about 1 x 2 cm) directly into the boiling water. If you have a special halusky (or spaetzle) sieve or press, you can use that too. </li>

	<li>Drip several halusky dumplings in at a time. They will sink to the bottom so give them a quick stir. </li>

	<li>Cook halusky until they float to the top and have changed color. Strain out with a slotted spoon, hand strainer and place into a colander to drain. Repeat the boiling process until all the batter is cooked. </li>
	<li>Once all halusky are cooked, let drain for 2-3 minutes minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and mix with the cheese until evenly coated. If you like it extra creamy, mix in some whipping or heavy cream. </li>
	<li>Divide halusky onto plates and top with the fried bacon! </li>

  <ul>
    <li>500g pack bread mix </li>
    <li>	1 tsp olive oil, plus a little extra for the dough </li>
    <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
    <li>	250g extra-lean minced beef</li>
    <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
    <li>	2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>	1 tbsp red chilli flakes</li>
    <li>	5 tbsp tomato purée</li>

  <li>	400g jar sweet pickled peppadew peppers, roughly chopped </li>
    <li>	50g feta cheese, crumbled</li>
    <li>1 tbsp pine nuts</li>

  </ul>

  <p> Recipe </p>
<ol>
  <li>Mix the dough following pack instructions (leave about 2 tbsp of the bread mix in the bag for dusting and rolling out later). Knead for 8-10 mins, then coat the dough in oil, place in a large bowl and cover. </li>
    <li> Leave to rise until doubled in size. The warmer your kitchen is, the faster it will rise, but generally it should take 1-2 hrs. </li>
  <li>	Heat oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 9 (or the highest setting). Sprinkle 2 baking trays with a little of the reserved flour and place in the oven to heat up. </li>
  <li>Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan until hot. Add the onions and garlic, and cook for a few mins until softened. Add the beef and let it brown for about 5 mins, breaking up the mince as it cooks. Pour off any excess oil. </li>
    <li>Add the spices, chilli, 2 tbsp of the tomato purée, 5 tbsp of the pomegranate molasses and some seasoning. Cook for 1 min, then remove from the heat. </li>
  <li>	Divide the dough into 6 balls. Sprinkle the remaining flour over a work surface and roll out the dough, each to about 25cm across. Remove the trays from the oven and place 2 pizza bases on each (you’ll need to cook in batches).  </li>
    <li>Spread the remaining tomato purée on each base. Top with the meat mixture, peppers, feta and pine nuts. Cook for 10 mins or until the bases are cooked through and golden brown around the edges. Drizzle over the remaining pomegranate molasses and serve. </li>

  <h4> United Kingdom Recipe: Fish and Chips </h4>
<img src="uk.jpg" height= 300px width= 400px>
  <p> Ingredients </p>
<ul>
  <li>	800g unpeeled, even-size Maris Piper or King Edward potato <li>
	<li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>  300g frozen garden pea</li>
  <li> 1 tbsp olive oil </li>
   <li>2 tsp lemon juice </li>
  <li>650g (approx) skinless haddock, hake or cod fillet from a sustainable source, cut into 4 equal-size pieces </li>
<li>  50g self-raising flour, plus 1 tbsp </li>
  <li>	50g cornflour </li>
  <li>1 egg white </li>
  <li>125ml ice-cold sparkling water </li>
  <li>1 lemon, cut into wedges </li>
  <li>	600ml sunflower oil, for frying </li>

</ul>
  <p> Recipe </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Scrub the potatoes, cut into 1.5cm thick lengthways slices, then cut each slice into 1.5cm thick chips. Tip the chips into a large saucepan, pour in enough water to just cover, bring to the boil, then lower the heat and gently simmer for 4 mins only. Drain, tip onto a clean tea towel, pat dry, then leave to cool. Can be done 1-2 hrs ahead. Heat oven to 220C/gas 7. Put a large shallow non-stick roasting tray in the oven with 1 tbsp olive oil and heat for 10 mins. </li>
    <li>Transfer the chips to a bowl and toss in the remaining oil using your hands. Tip out in a single layer onto the hot roasting tin. Bake for 10 mins, then turn them over. Bake 5 more mins, then turn again. Bake for a final 5-8 mins until crisp. Drain on paper towels. </li>
    <li>While the chips are in the oven, cook the peas in boiling water for 4 mins. Drain, then tip into the pan and lightly crush with the back of a fork. Mix in the oil, lemon juice and freshly grated pepper. Cover and set aside.</li>
    <li>	The fish can also be cooked while the chips are in the oven. Pat the fillets dry with paper towels. Put the 1 tbsp of flour on a plate and use to coat each fillet, patting off the excess. Pour the oil for frying into a heavy, medium non-stick wok or wokshaped pan. </li>
      <li>Heat to 200C (use a thermometer so you can check the oil stays at that temperature). Mix 50g flour, cornflour, a pinch of salt and some pepper. Lightly whisk the egg white with a balloon whisk until frothy and bubbly, but not too stiff. </li>
        <li>Pour the water into the flour mix, gently and briefly whisking as you go. The batter shouldn’t be completely smooth. Add the egg white, then lightly whisk in just to mix. Try and keep as many bubbles as you can so the batter stays light. </li>
          <li>Cooking two pieces of fish at a time, dip them in the batter to coat, let some of it drip off, then lower into the hot oil using a slotted spoon. Fry for 5-6 mins, making sure the oil stays at 200C and turning the fish over halfway through so it is golden all over. Lift out with a slotted spoon, drain on kitchen paper. Check the oil is back up to 200C, then repeat with remaining fish. Reheat the peas and serve with the fish, chips and lemon wedges. </li>
